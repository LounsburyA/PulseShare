          <h3>What is SCS?</h3>
          <Typography>
            A spinal cord stimulator (SCS) device is surgically placed under your skin and sends a mild electric current
            to your spinal cord. Thin wires carry current from a pulse generator to the nerve fibers of the spinal cord.
            When turned on, the SCS stimulates the nerves in the area and provides pain relief or return of functionality
            in some cases.
